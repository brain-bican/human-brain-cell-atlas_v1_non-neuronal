CS202210140_15	Endo	https://purl.brain-bican.org/taxonomy/AIT_MTG/AIT_MTG.json	CrossArea_subclass:48e48631ba		We performed PCA (50 components) on our full dataset, trained a random forest classifier (scikit-learn, class_ weight=‘balanced’, max_depth=50) on the MTG labels, and then predicted labels for all cells. We labeled each cluster with the mode of its constituent cells if two conditions were met: more than 0.8 of predicted labels matched the mode, and the mean probability of these pre- dictions was greater than 0.8.
